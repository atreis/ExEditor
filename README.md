# RxEditor
SRM file editor.

After loading an SRM file, go to the advanced tab.  The other tabs haven't been implemented yet.  To edit an entry, double click it, then select the value to be changed.

Windows executable:
<a href="https://github.com/atreis/ExEditor/blob/master/winexe/RxEditor.zip">https://github.com/atreis/ExEditor/blob/master/winexe/RxEditor.zip</a>
Unzip to the directory of your choice.  From that directory, run RxEditor.exe.

I think this should be necessary, but if you get an error indicating a missing msvc dll, try installing the MS VC++ Runtime:
