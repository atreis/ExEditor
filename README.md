# RxEditor
SRM file editor.

After loading an SRM file, go to the advanced tab.  The other tabs haven't been implemented yet.  To edit an entry, double click it, then select the value to be changed.

Windows executable:
<a href="https://github.com/atreis/ExEditor/blob/master/winexe/RxEditor.zip">https://github.com/atreis/ExEditor/blob/master/winexe/RxEditor.zip</a>
Unzip somewhere.  You should be able to run it from that location.

If you get an error indicating a missing msvc dll, try installing the MS VC++ Runtime:
